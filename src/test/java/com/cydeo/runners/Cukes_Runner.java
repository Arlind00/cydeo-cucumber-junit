/*
UNDERSTANDING HOW FEATURE FILES AND STEP DEFINITIONS WORK TOGETHER
TC#50: Create a new feature file and new scenarios
1. Create a new feature file named Login.feature
2. Create 3 new scenarios from the below provided user story.
3. User Story:
As a user, I should be able to login with correct credentials to different accounts.
And dashboard should be displayed.
Accounts are: librarian, student, admin
4. Create a new step definition class under step_definitions package
named: LoginStepDefs
5. Run the code. Get the step definitions from the console
6. No Java-selenium code implementation needed. Just add printing line in the
implementation regarding what should be happening when the code is ran.
Ex: “User is on the login page”
 */    // task

// 1. Create a feature file under file directory
// 2. Write feature and scenario inside newly created file
